AZ OUTAGE
* Minimum RTO for single AZ outage event: 5 minutes
During a planned/unplanned outage of RDS DB, AWS makes automatic failover to the replica (configured in another AZ). Failover usually takes a couple of minutes but the total time for RTO is determined by the pending transactions on the source database.

* Minimum RPO for single AZ outage event: 0 minutes
With configured Multi-AZ DB configuration and replication in place, no data loss is expected.

REGION OUTAGE
* Minimum RTO for single region outage event: 25 minutes
During a region outage, support team needs to perform manual procedure for region failover;
	- Promote read-only replica in DR region
	- Perform scripts to update DB connections in applications 
	- Perform validations 

* Minimum RPO for single AZ outage event: 0 minutes
With configured read-only replica in DR region, no data loss is expected.
